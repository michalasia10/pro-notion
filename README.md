# Project Overlay Management for Notion

## üìù Overview

This project is a browser extension and web app that provides an advanced project management overlay on top of Notion. It aims to solve common pain points for Notion users who use it for project management, enhancing their experience with features that are not natively available.

The application will inject an overlay into Notion pages, providing advanced views and functionalities without requiring users to migrate their data out of Notion.
